## Preliminary Thesis Title
**Seamless Learning: Designing a Scheduling-Enhanced LMS for Improved Engagement**

## Provisional Thesis Abstract
The rapid evolution of educational technology has underscored the necessity for adaptive and efficient Learning Management Systems (LMS) to address diverse learner and institutional needs. This thesis presents a novel LMS featuring an optimal scheduling algorithm designed to enhance user engagement and streamline both educational and administrative workflows. By employing advanced scheduling techniques customized to meet the unique demands of New Paltz, the system dynamically personalizes learning schedules to balance workload, deadlines, and individual preferences, fostering an intuitive and seamless learning experience.

This research addresses the limitations of traditional LMS platforms and bridges the gap between static functionality and the growing need for adaptive, time-efficient solutions. The proposed system's impact is assessed through a comprehensive process of design, implementation, and evaluation, including case studies and user testing. Key metrics such as course completion rates, learner satisfaction, and system usability are analyzed to demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness.

The findings aim to establish the potential of scheduling-enhanced LMS platforms as transformative tools in digital education, offering educators and learners innovative means to optimize efficiency, autonomy, and engagement.
